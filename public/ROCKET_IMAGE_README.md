# Rocket Image Required

The Hero component requires a rocket image to function properly.

## Image Requirements

- **File Name:** `rocket.png`
- **Location:** Place the file in this `public` folder
- **Format:** PNG (transparent background recommended)
- **Recommended Size:** 700px width or larger (will be scaled up 5x in the component)

## Where to Get the Image

1. Use your own rocket/spacecraft illustration
2. Download a royalty-free rocket image from:
   - Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/rocket
   - Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/search/rocket/
   - Flaticon: https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=rocket

## Note

The component will still render without the image, but you'll see a broken image placeholder. Make sure to add `rocket.png` to the `public` folder before deployment.
