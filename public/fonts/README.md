# Black Mango Font Files

Please place your Black Mango font files in this directory with the following naming convention:

- `BlackMango-Regular.woff2` (or `.woff`, `.ttf`)
- `BlackMango-Medium.woff2` (or `.woff`, `.ttf`)
- `BlackMango-Bold.woff2` (or `.woff`, `.ttf`)

The font is configured to use `.woff2` format first (best compression), then fall back to `.woff`, and finally `.ttf` if needed.

**Note:** Black Mango is a commercial font. Make sure you have the proper license to use it in your project.
